# It's not all about gender: A Multi-dimensional Course Perspective on Diversity and Inclusion in Software Engineering Education (Supplementary Material)

## Project Description
This repository contain the artefacts collected for an experience report details how we approached diversity dimensions in a graduate school course -- attended by both MSc and PhD students -- on Diversity and Inclusion in Software Engineering. We explored two perspectives: users and teams, which relate to the subdomains of Software Requirements and Human Aspects of Software Engineering, respectively.
