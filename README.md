# It's not all about gender: A Multi-dimensional Course Perspective on Diversity and Inclusion in Software Engineering Education (Supplementary Material)

## Project Description
This repository contains the artifacts collected for an experience report that details how we addressed the dimensions of diversity in a graduate course -- attended by master's and doctoral students -- on Diversity and Inclusion in Software Engineering. In this course we explored two perspectives: users and teams, which relate to the subdomains of Software Requirements and Human Aspects of Software Engineering, respectively.
